My games business projects and progress

Aardvark Swift is a games recruitment agency: they work primarily for video games industry (est. 1989) but also in other gaming industries e.g. casinos and special effects. There is a gap between industry and academia. Most games studios ask for the top three qualities:
- C++
- Mathematics (part of the programming test)
- Portfolio

My games business projects and progress

Aardvark Swift is a games recruitment agency: they work primarily for video games industry (est. 1989) but also in other gaming industries e.g. casinos and special effects. There is a gap between industry and academia. Most games studios ask for the top three qualities:
- C++
- Mathematics (part of the programming test)
- Portfolio

Artists need to be highly skilled in 2D and 3D software e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Blender, 3dMax. While most graduates tend to be practiced in a variety of fields, there are also people who are highly specialised. Technical artists are an example, and require Scripting in Python, PyMEL, Maxscript, and Maya or Blender. Graduate animators also require excellent knowledge of 3D animation packages, with Maya experience.

What studios look for in a code portfolio:
First thing to do is to separate student projects from professional projects. Ensure that the portfolio has a completed game, a minimum requirement. A video play through of the game as a showreel is also essential. Having the game work across platforms demonstrates versatility. Have plenty of code samples on repositories like GitHub, and ensure that all documentation is well-written, easy to read, and properly structured. If participating in group projects, highlight / distinguish precisely which contributions are owned by which developer / coder. Have an online portfolio on a website and a blurb that links the demo video to the portfolio website.

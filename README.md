My games business projects and progress

Aardvark Swift is a games recruitment agency: they work primarily for video games industry (est. 1989) but also in other gaming industries e.g. casinos and special effects. There is a gap between industry and academia. Most games studios ask for the top three qualities:
- C++
- Mathematics (part of the programming test)
- Portfolio

Artists need to be highly skilled in 2D and 3D software e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Blender, 3dMax. While most graduates tend to be practiced in a variety of fields, there are also people who are highly specialised. Technical artists are an example, and require Scripting in Python, PyMEL, Maxscript, and Maya or Blender. Graduate animators also require excellent knowledge of 3D animation packages, with Maya experience.

What studios look for in a code portfolio:
First thing to do is to separate student projects from professional projects. Ensure that the portfolio has a completed game, a minimum requirement. A video play through of the game as a showreel is also essential. Having the game work across platforms demonstrates versatility. Have plenty of code samples on repositories like GitHub, and ensure that all documentation is well-written, easy to read, and properly structured. If participating in group projects, highlight / distinguish precisely which contributions are owned by which developer / coder. Have an online portfolio on a website and a blurb that links the demo video to the portfolio website.

What games studios look for in an artist’s portfolio:
Have a portfolio website with proper layout — sections and folders should be properly organised. A clear breakdown of the concept, articulation, and management of the workflows used to create the art. Positions for artists are typically the most competitive and studios look for a unique style that is genuine and authentic to the artist’s vision. Quality over quantity is always the mantra of the day.

This entry is from the Art Director of Boss Alien for aspiring artists in the games industry:
Ensure a valid email is supplied with all portfolios, and links must work. The order of work is important and must be listed in a structured, logical format. Give plenty of information on life outside games development to paint a full picture. Sell yourself. Have a goal and vision of where you want to be. As a games artist you have to learn to analyse and critique games for what they are and how they are created. It is not about playing games that gets a job; instead it is about understanding and explaining the processes of game design and game play. ArtStation is a great portfolio tool, but websites are also fine. But beware that as an artist, your website has to communicate your creativity. Think about your design choices that communicate your mental processes. Have downloadable PDFs for employers to keep and revisit later. The quality of presentation is extremely important and should never detract from the work done. If doing animation, keep it simple and of high quality. Same principle applies to environmental artists. Do pieces with different styles to show not only breadth but depth of understanding of the subject.

What games studios look for in an animator’s showreel:
A showreel is essential. Captions are very important in these showreels. Pick comfortable music that does not overpower the scene or is misaligned with the intention of the message. If a character has been animated, studios want to know how. In the showreel, a common mantra is to start with the best work and end with the second-best work. For in-game animations, ensure the scene shows mastery of the basics — walk cycles, run cycles, attacks — as well as the ability to integrate with other games functions.

What games studios look for in a CV:
A clean introduction with a clear vision, is the first step. Then list all the technical skills starting with the ones with most proficiency. This should be followed by all the relevant positions held within the games industry. Then list all educational qualifications, and mention a thesis statement if relevant. This should be followed by lower school education. Part-time jobs are also relevant, not for the role but for the responsibilities held in that role. Finally end with hobbies and interests, and ensure that games is on that list. Other hobbies are also relevant to humanise candidates to studios. An achievement section, where feasible, is also beneficial, especially if this section includes game jams.

Getting into Games: Networking and Events:
Setup a profile on LinkedIn. Post regularly on LinkedIn and join likeminded groups that focus on games. Also join competitions that are open to game developers and designers, where the prize is a position at a games studio. C++ is usually the tested programming skill. For example, competitors will get a half-finished block of code which contestants need to complete, identify, debug then run on Unity or Unreal Engine. These competitions can be added to the portfolio. The Grads In Games competition (Rising Star) is a fantastic opportunity to not just get people jobs but to find out about how games studio really work, and get a feel for the realities of the industry. Winners as well as finalists and the top 20 to 30 students also get jobs which are recognised by the industry. Quality is the goal, not quantity, and the studio managers get to meet students in person to understand them better. Network with companies like Aardwark Swift to keep on top of the rapid changes in the industry.

<h3>Key Considerations in Games Development:</h3>
• Process: Waterfall scheduling model of building games<br/>
• Development: Start with current physics and processes<br/>
• Deployment: Knock on effects<br/>
• Teamwork: Working holistically as a team / unit<br/>
• Framework: MVP and then value-added embellishments<br/>

<h3>MVP-Related Points:</h3>
• problems are indiscernible patterns<br/>
• what is it that I can do that no one else can<br/>
• disruption = breaking an existing pattern<br/>
• innovation = forming a new pattern<br/>
• importance of imputing<br/>
• reward mechanic - discovery; instant; exclusive recommendations from peers<br/>

<h3>LEAN Characteristics and Traits</h3>
• customer-centric development<br/>
• rapidly iterate MVP which is always ready to ship<br/>
• access to the early adopting customer is critical<br/>
• key success indicators<br/>

<h3>Maslow's Hierarchy Management Considerations</h3>
• turn Maslow’s hierarchy upside down for game interaction
• USP - what is my unfair advantage? (e.g. theme park rollercoaster game: 1st person ride the ride technology
• designing for the masses is an individualistic exercise because you have to create quality, which can never happen with design democracy.

<h3>Real vs Realistic</h3>
The most likely risk in a game is that people may not want to play it because the game is derivative, others already have a better alternative etc. Think about the real risks of building a computer game. Is a USP actually good enough to be a USB? Consider the mitigation for the risk. If my product does not entertain it does not fulfil its purpose.

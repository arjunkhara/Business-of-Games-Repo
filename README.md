My games business projects and progress

Aardvark Swift is a games recruitment agency: they work primarily for video games industry (est. 1989) but also in other gaming industries e.g. casinos and special effects. There is a gap between industry and academia. Most games studios ask for the top three qualities:
- C++
- Mathematics (part of the programming test)
- Portfolio

Artists need to be highly skilled in 2D and 3D software e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Blender, 3dMax. While most graduates tend to be practiced in a variety of fields, there are also people who are highly specialised. Technical artists are an example, and require Scripting in Python, PyMEL, Maxscript, and Maya or Blender. Graduate animators also require excellent knowledge of 3D animation packages, with Maya experience.
